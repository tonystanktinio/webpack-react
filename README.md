# YouTube Super Simple webpack Example

After cloning / downloading / forking this repoistory you just need to have a command-line pointing inside this overall directory and use the `npm install` command. This assumes you already have Node.js installed on your computer.

After that, you can now use `npm run dev` to have the devServer up and running which you can visit in your browser at `localhost:8080`

You can also use `npm run build` to actually make sure the latest bundled file is saved to your hard drive in the `dist` folder. The dev task simply stores the file in memory and makes it available at `localhost:8080/myBundle.js` for the fastest possible performance.

In the real world you wouldn't have the source code for your "index.html" page in the dist folder, but I did that for this simple example just to avoid any further automation / configuration.
